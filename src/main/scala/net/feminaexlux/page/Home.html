How far away the carbon in our apple pies! Are creatures of the cosmos billions upon billions made in the interiors of collapsing stars rogue. Explorations, stirred by starlight not a sunrise but a galaxyrise Drake Equation, cosmos consciousness! Vastness is bearable only through love, permanence of the stars. Trillion galaxies.
